Contribution  Of  Team  Members
1.Shewani Chib -  Given Logic ,given the code to the program execution of program on LINUX and made the report of the assignment 
2.Shivangi Srivastava - Debugging


INSTRUCTIONS:
1. g++ KruskalsMST.cpp
    a.out 
2. Enter the no. of vertices and edges in int main()
3. Enter the  source and destination edge and weight of the edge
4. Run

EXAMPLES: 
       INPUT:
1- no. of vertices = 4
    no. of edges =5

    src = 0
    dest = 1
    weight = 10

    src =0 
     dest =2
    weight = 6

    src = 0
    dest = 3
    weight =5

    src = 1
    dest = 3
    weight = 15

    src = 2
    dest = 3
    weight = 4
 
       OUTPUT:
 Following are the edges in constructed MST:
     2 -- 3 == 4
     0 -- 3 == 5
     0 -- 1 == 10

 CHALLENGES  FACED:-
   1. Not able to get union find approach
   2. Implementing various function calls
 

HOW DID I OVERCOME :
 1.To accomplish the program  I took help from youtube and various website
